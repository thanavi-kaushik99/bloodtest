The donation of blood is important because most often people requiring blood do not receive it on  time causing loss of life. Examples include severe accidents, patients suffering from dengue or  malaria, or organ transplants. Extreme health conditions such as Leukemia and bone marrow  cancer, where affected individuals experience sudden high blood loss and need an urgent supply  of blood and do not have it can also lead to loss of life. Sound data-driven systems for tracking  and predicting donations and supply needs can improve the entire supply chain, making sure that  more patients get the blood transfusions they need, which can reduce mortality risk.In this project we have used logistic regression,random forest algorithm and it also supports vector machine.
